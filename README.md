Description
a 2d platformer

## Implementation

## What Makes this a Game?

competence: By not only collecting coins, but entering combat you can gain more and more score, also there is a final goal of the what you trying to heist.

automy: There is not a ton of autonomy, its a fairly linear 2D platformer so there isnt much variety. The only major ones are if you want to enter combat or just avoid. 

relatedness: I feel like it may be hard to relate to a career criminal in the future, but I chose this setting due to it being one of my favorite settings in fiction. Some of my favorite movies are the blade runner games and one of my favorite games of all time is cyberpunk 2077, with some obvious influence from both sources.
